read_nc.c reads netCDF data and and converts it into ASCII format This should 
make it easier to import data into GRASS GIS. The source was provided by Thomas 
Huld of JRC.

From Thomas' email:
>I've attached the C program to read the .nc files and output ARC ASCII.
>
>It compiles as:
>
>gcc -c -O2 read_nc.c
>gcc read_nc.o -lnetcdf  -o read_nc
>
>You execute it as
>
>./read_nc <xc> <yc> <infile>
>
>Here xc is the number of pixels in each row in the image, and yc is the number
>of rows. You can get these numbers using ncdump -h <infile1, infile2....> In
>the first few lines of the output you see:

>dimensions:
>        xc = 5204 ;
>        yc = 2704 ;
>......

>I'm sure there is a way to get the program to read these values from the
>netcdf file, but I haven't found it yet.

>The output for one time slot is called: raw_YYYYMMDD_HHmm.asc
